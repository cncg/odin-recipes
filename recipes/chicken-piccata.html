            <h3 class="head-two">Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
            <li>4 Skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>Cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
            <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>All-purpose flour for dredging</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon capers, drained</li>
            <li>½ Cup white wine</li>
            <li>¼ Cup fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>¼ Cup water</li>
            <li>3 Tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut in ¼ inch slices</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons fresh Italian parsley, chopped</li>
        </ul>

    <h3 class="head-three">Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place chicken breast between 2 layers of plastic wrap and pound to about a half inch thickness.</li>
            <li>Season both sides of the chicken breasts with cayenne, salt and black pepper. Dredge lightly in flour and shake off any excess.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the pan, reduce heat to medium, and cook until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Remove to a plate.</li>
            <li>Cook capers in reserved oil, smashing them lightly to release brine, until warmed through, about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Pour white wine into skillet. Scrape any browned bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook until reduced by half, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir lemon juice, water and butter into the reduced wine mixture; cook and stir continuously to form a thick sauce, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and sift parsley through the sauce.</li>
            <li>Return chicken breasts to the pan, cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve with sauce spooned over the top.</li>
            <li><strong>Enjoy</strong></li>
