            <li>Stir lemon juice, water and butter into the reduced wine mixture; cook and stir continously to form a thick sauce, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and stif parsely through the sauce.</li>
            <li>Return chicken breasts to the pan, cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve with sauce spooned over the top.</li>
