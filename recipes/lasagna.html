                <li>¼ Teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>4 Tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
                <li>12 Lasagna noodles</li>
                <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
                <li>1 egg</li>
                <li>¾ Pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
                <li>¾ Cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered for about 1 and a half hours. Stir occasionally.</li>
                    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley and half teaspoon salt.</li>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (or 190 degrees C)</li>
                    <li>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with ¼ cup of Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil! To prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
                    <li>Bake in preheated oven for a nice 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake an additional 25 minutes. Finally, cool for 10-15 minutes before serving.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enjoy</strong></li>
